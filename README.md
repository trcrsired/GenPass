# WasmPass

WasmPass is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that showcases password, username, and PIN generation using WebAssembly.  
It provides a simple interface for generating secure data and includes usability enhancements like dark mode and a Back to Top button.

This WasmPass is **empowered by [fast_io](https://github.com/cppfastio/fast_io)**.  
It is directly copied from the author's fast_io library example for generating passwords, usernames, and PINs, and both implementations share **identical behaviors**.
This ensures consistency between the native C++ implementation and the WebAssembly WasmPass.
